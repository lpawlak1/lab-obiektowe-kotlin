# Exercises done for object-oriented programming course

## Introduction

These exercises were done precisely with [this github](https://github.com/apohllo/obiektowe-lab/tree/13940d969b91c72115c455a319b3a36d03dd43b6).
But with one small yet important change.
I was doing it in Kotlin while most exercises were written so they would be easy to do in Java.
So some topics are done differently in this repository. 
Like observer pattern is done with functions instead of classes (in Java).

## How to use/ see better process 

Well these are incrementally done task so everything is in here, but there are tags.
Just go to [tags](https://github.com/lpawlak1/lab-obiektowe-kotlin/tags) and choose whichever you like.
